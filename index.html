<!-- 🍉 Fifty Thousand Names by Leo Scarin -->

<!-- 
Fifty Thousand Names is a hard-coded message of grief for each of the 
(now more than) fifty thousand names of Palestinian martyrs who won't 
witness Gaza's liberation. It uses a live dataset from Tech for Palestine, 
an organisation of developers supporting Palestinian resistance. (data.techforpalestine.org)

Data visualization won't fix the ongoing genocide. But it can draw a 
starting point that moves people to action, boycott, and daily exercises 
of building a culture of human dignity. 

This webpage was made in the occasion of a Coding Against Genocide session in The Hague in March 2025.
codingagainstgenocide.org is a collective of creative coders concerned with the ongoing Israeli genocide in Gaza.
We use creativity and code to advocate for a culture of human dignity, peace, and justice.

// This code was as tough to make as it was sad to digest.
// I'm thinking of all the IDF data analysts. 
// All their statisticians. 
// All their specialists handling this amount of names.
// How do they read the birthdays and not break into tears?

// Dehumanisation happens, too, when a name becomes a number;
// when a civilian victim becomes the margin of error of some AI-powered weapon;
// not only when crimes are denied, but *especially* when they are normalised.
// I don't want to have to do a website like this, ever again.

// Leo
